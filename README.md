## SQLite Database Usage

The banking application utilizes SQLite to store and manage bank account details efficiently. Below is an overview of how SQLite is integrated into the application and its role in storing data:

### Database Structure

The SQLite database consists of a single table named `CLIENTS`, which stores information about bank clients and their accounts. The table schema includes the following fields:

- `ID`: Unique identifier for each client account.
- `NAME`: Client's name.
- `ADDRESS`: Client's address.
- `PHONE`: Client's phone number.
- `TYPE`: Type of bank account (Basic or Saving).
- `BALANCE`: Current balance in the account.

### Integration with the Application

- **Initialization**: Upon starting the application, the SQLite database is opened to allow interaction with client data.

- **Account Creation**: When a bank account is created by a bank employee, the client's information, including their name, address, phone number, chosen account type, and starting balance, is inserted into the `CLIENTS` table.

- **Account Listing**: The application retrieves client information from the `CLIENTS` table to display a list of clients and their associated accounts.

- **Account Operations**: Withdrawal and deposit operations involve updating the account balance in the SQLite database based on user input.

### Error Handling

In case of any database-related errors, appropriate error messages are displayed to the user, ensuring a smooth user experience.
